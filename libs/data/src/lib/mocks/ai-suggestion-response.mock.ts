  notes:
    'This tone setup provides a classic blues tone. The amp settings are crafted for a warm, clean sound. The Blues Driver pedal adds a little bit of overdrive for that gritty blues break-up. The suggested Spring Reverb and Analog Delay pedals add some depth and space to the overall tone.',
